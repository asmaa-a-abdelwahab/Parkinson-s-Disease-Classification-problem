### PARKINSON'S DISEASE PREDICTION USING SUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS


- The aim of the project is to examine several classification techniques to classify the status of people to Health (1) or Parkinson's (0). We do this by applying supervised learning methods for Parkinson's disease prediction by interpreting the voice measures of the voice recordings of each individual saying only a single term.
